            <h1>Tell us the differences between uncontrolled and controlled components.</h1>
            <p>Ans. An uncontrolled component is a form element such as input, textarea, or select that manages its own state internally. When a user interacts with the form element, its state is updated automatically without any intervention from the parent component. <br />
            A controlled component, on the other hand, is a form element whose state is controlled by the parent component.
